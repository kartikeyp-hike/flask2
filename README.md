# Hello World Flask App 🌍
[This is AI Generated, ignore this]
This project is a simple Flask web application designed to demonstrate the basic structure of a Flask app. It serves a "Hello World!" message when a user accesses the root URL. It's perfect for beginners getting started with Flask or for quickly prototyping web applications.

🚀 **Key Features:**

*   **Basic Routing:** Defines a route for the root URL ("/") using Flask's routing capabilities.
*   **Simple View Function:** Includes a `home()` function that handles requests to the root route and returns a simple text response.
*   **Development Server:** Configures and starts the Flask development server for local testing.
*   **Minimal Dependencies:** Only requires the Flask framework, making it easy to set up and run.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**

*   **Backend:**
    *   [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/): A micro web framework written in Python.
*   **Language:**
    *   Python
*   **Build Tools:**
    *   pip (Python Package Installer)
